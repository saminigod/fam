FAM was invented by Wiltse Carpenter, Brendan Eich, Bruce Karsh and Eva
Manolis at Silicon Graphics (now SGI).

FAM was written for IRIX by Bruse Karsh in 1988/89, and was rewritten in
1995 by Bob Miller.

IMon was written in 1989 by Wiltse Carpenter, and ported to Linux by
Roger Chickering.

FAM was released as Open Source, and many changes and bug fixes were made
by Roger Chickering, Wes Smith, and Rusty Ballinger.

Many contributions have been made recently, especially by Alex Larsson of
Red Hat.
