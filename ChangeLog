    Bumped version numbers to 2.7.0
    (mraymond@sgi.com)

fam-2.7.0-pre2

fam-2.7.0-pre1

    removed const modifier from Scheduler.h to fix GCC 3.x build.

    created new GNU autotools files:
    - test whether we have IMon rather than testing OS.
    - test whether we have sockaddr length members rather than testing OS.
    - install daemon in sbin rather than bin.
    - install manual pages in typical GNU/Linux sections.
    - rename daemon to famd.
    - rename fam source directory to src.
    - rename libfam source directory to lib.
    - remove editconf and util subdirectory.

    [wardle@sgi.com] (wardle@sgi.com)

    fixed warnings about typenames in BTree.h.
    (wardle@sgi.com)

fam-2.6.10

    removed const from Scheduler.h to fix GCC 3 build.
    (wardle@sgi.com)

    use GID_NOBODY if NOGROUP is undefined to build on SysV-like
    operating systems including IRIX.
    (wardle@sgi.com)

fam-2.6.9

    added idle_timeout and nfs_polling_interval options to fam.conf.
    [joup@bigfoot.com, wardle@sgi.com] (wardle@sgi.com)

    use daemon() as an alternative to _daemonize() to background the
    fam process if it is available.
    [wardle@sgi.com] (wardle@sgi.com)

    allow for different socket structure on FreeBSD and other small
    changes to assist FreeBSD build.
    [daverufino@btinternet.com, ports@geeksrus.net] (wardle@sgi.com)

fam-2.6.8

    #include some standard header files to help build on FreeBSD.
    (wardle@sgi.com)

    improved group handling from IRIX.
    (wardle@sgi.com) 

    untrusted user's GID is set to NOGROUP if getgrmember() gave FAM
    an invalid or inconsistent GID.
    (wardle@sgi.com)

    should now handle strerror returning null.
    (wardle@sgi.com)

    initalize libtool earlier in the configure process to avoid binaries
    being created with a .C extension on some systems.
    [alexl@redhat.com] (wardle@sgi.com)

    added libstdc++ to linker flags to make libfam always build as a
    C++ library.
    (wardle@sgi.com)

    added CLEANFILES make target.
    (wardle@sgi.com)

    /etc/mtab (or equivalent) is now opened read-only.

    (wardle@sgi.com)

    updated man page to correctly show NFS polling interval.
    (wardle@sgi.com)

    check more file attributes to avoid race.
    [alexl@redhat.com] (wardle@sgi.com)

    log pipe errors more selectively.
    [alexl@redhat.com] (wardle@sgi.com)

fam-2.6.6

    Always put temporary files in /tmp (ignore $TMPDIR) so users can connect
    to fam using sockets even if the user can't read $TMPDIR.
    (wardle@sgi.com)

    Correctly set effective uid so that more than one user can use fam
    simultaneously on systems that use BSD-style restricted chown.
    [alexl@redhat.com] (wardle@sgi.com)

    Only remove FAM configuration in RPM if FAM is being uninstalled,
    not if it's being upgraded.
    (rusty@sgi.com)

    We now report changes when mtime or ctime change, not just ctime.
    Also, on IRIX, where the stat struct has nanoseconds, FAM checks it.
    (wessmith@sgi.com, rusty@sgi.com)

    Dropped "oss" from version number.
    (rusty@sgi.com)

fam-oss-2.6.5

    Fix for bug 796109, where if we didn't have imon support and we were
    monitoring a file which didn't exist, we would stop monitoring when it
    was created.  (wessmith)

    Added tests to rpm.spec.in to handle upgrades, where rpm runs our install
    scripts in the wrong order.  (rusty)

    RPM package now Requires: /usr/sbin/inetd (wessmith)

    fam spec file now being generated by configure script.  (rusty)

fam-oss-2.6.4

    Stupid, gratuitous breakage of the FAM API introduced by Rusty in 2.6.0,
    and only partially fixed in 2.6.1, is fixed "again."  The difference is
    that FAMPending now returns 1 instead of -1 on error/EOF.

    Both "make install" and the RPM packages generated by "make rpm" now
    add fam to /etc/rpc and /etc/inetd.conf, and /usr/local/lib (or
    wherever libfam.so is installed) to /etc/ld.so.conf if it's not already
    there.

    libfam includes a list of exported symbols (only the symbols in fam.h),
    even though there seem to be some issues with libtool handling them
    correctly.  Thanks to Waldo Bastian for pointing me at the right libtool
    option.

    The last version contained another gross failure to build without imon
    support on Linux, introduced by Rusty, fixed in this version by Wesley
    Smith.

    The fam(3X) man page is more clear about how to use FAMPending and
    FAMNextEvent.

fam-oss-2.6.3

    This contains a bunch of fixes contributed by Porter Schermerhorn
    (Elmoe), David Kelly, Sumit Bose, Rasterman, Peter Zijlstra, Mandrake,
    Ingvaldur Sigurjónsson, (and I've forgotten others?), for building with
    gcc-2.95.2.  Note that I don't actually have a working gcc-2.95.2, and
    it's quite possible that I goofed up merging some of the patches, but
    it builds on my boxes without setting CFLAGS...

    This also has portions of Sumit Bose's patches for building on IRIX 5.3,
    but unfortunately not enough to actually build on IRIX 5.3.

    This also has support for building RPM packages.
    ("./configure && make rpm")

fam-oss-2.6.2

    "Fixed" error message in SYSLOG when clients terminate.  (The behavior is
    the same; now it just doesn't log an error message.)  Thanks to Andras
    Balogh.

    Configure script changes:
      - It's better about caching the results of its tests.
      - If it thinks you don't have imon support, it prints out a big warning
        message with some advice.
      - The dumb tests for uname = IRIX are still dumb, but less broken; now
        they catch uname IRIX64, too.
      - Added a "support" subdir and a sample test for reimplementations of
        stuff that's missing on different platforms (like snprintf on 6.3),
        but at the moment it's empty because I didn't finish incorporating
        the patch which Wesley Smith sent Rolf Schreiber for compiling on
        IRIX 6.3.

fam-oss-2.6.1

    Stupid, gratuitous breakage of the FAM API introduced by Rusty in 2.6.0 has
    been fixed.  (FAMPending and FAMNextEvent no longer worked as advertised
    when they got an EOF.)  Thanks to Wesley Smith.

    The "echo -e" configure script fix is included.  Thanks to Henning
    Meier-Geinitz, Charles E. Campbell, Robert F. Phillips II, and others.

    "-n32 -mips3" is no longer hard-coded in the configure script for compiling
    on IRIX.  Now there's a better chance of the ABI being chosen correctly,
    and if you want to control it, you can set the ABI in your CXXFLAGS
    environment variable instead of having to edit the nasty configure script.

    Added ii_files/*.ii to CLEANFILES in some of the Makefile.am's so that SGI
    compiler prelinker files get cleaned up by "make clean".  (Matters if you
    want to switch between ABIs.)

    The version number changed from 2.6.0 to oss-2.6.1.  The "oss" is just to
    emphasize that the version numbers between fam-bundled-with-IRIX and
    fam-open-source are not comparable.  (The fam which will be in IRIX 6.5.8
    calls itself "fam 2.6.0", but it has some of the same fixes as the
    open-source 2.6.1.)  I will be sorry later that I wasn't smarter about the
    version numbers at the start.

    This version does not contain a fix for the SYSLOG message when a client
    shuts down, and does not yet include the patch which Wesley Smith sent
    Rolf Schreiber for compiling on IRIX 6.3.

fam-2.6.0

    This is the first OSS version.
