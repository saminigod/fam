KNOWN BUGS

- When built with DNotify, famming a file will open a file
  handle on that device, making it difficult to unmount the
  device the file is on.  This is how DNotify works.

- There is a limit to the number of files a famd client can
  monitor simultaneously.  On some platforms this is 1024,
  on others it is 4096.

SLIGHTLY BROKEN STUFF

- The way we check for an NFS filesystem isn't very good.

- BTree iteration could be better.

MISSING FEATURES

- Support for kernel file monitors other than IMon.

- Ability to disable monitoring of very slow filesystems.
