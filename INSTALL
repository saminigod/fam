BUILDING & INSTALLING FAM

The standard way to build and install FAM is as follows:

    ./configure
    make
    make install


STARTING FAM

FAM uses RPC, and is usually started by a superserver such as inetd or xinetd.

To manually add FAM:

1. Add FAM to your portmapper

   Add this line to /etc/rpc:
    sgi_fam         391002  famd             # File Alteration Monitor

2. Add FAM to your superserver

   If you use inetd, add this line to /etc/inetd.conf
    famd/1-2 stream  rpc/tcp wait    root    /usr/local/sbin/famd    famd

   then tell inetd to reread its configuration file:
    killall -HUP inetd

   If you use xinetd, add a file similar to the following in /etc/xinetd.d/

    --8<-----8<-----8<-----8<-----8<-----8<-----8<-----8<-----8<--
    # default: on
    # description: File Alteration Monitor (FAM) daemon
    service famd
    {
    	type		= RPC UNLISTED
    	socket_type	= stream
    	user		= root
    	group		= nobody
    	server		= /usr/local/sbin/famd
    	wait		= yes
    	protocol	= tcp
    	rpc_version	= 2
    	rpc_number	= 391002
    }
    --8<-----8<-----8<-----8<-----8<-----8<-----8<-----8<-----8<--

    If you do not want to use either, start FAM with the -T0 option:
     /usr/local/sbin/famd -T 0

    Naturally you will need to place this in your system's startup
    file if you want it to be automatically started.


3. Ensure that FAM is registered with the portmapper

   Run this and make sure that you get at least one line of output:
    rpcinfo -p | grep fam

   if you don't, you may need to restart your portmapper and (x)inetd.
